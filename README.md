# Stirling Golf Community

Stirling Golf Community was created for the golf club members in the area of Stirling shire. The website creates a platform for members, of 3 clubs (Stirling Golf Club, Bridge of Allan Golf Club, Dunblane Golf Club), to interact and play golf together.  

The website provides a Sign-Up form for the members to get involved in the community and pick and choose when they would be able to play. From there the organisers will selct people form different handicap groups to play with each other. This gives everyone the opportunity to learn and feel like part of a local community.
