                    Set against the inspiring backdrop of the Old Town of Stirling, built on ancient volcanic slopes, and crowned by the historic Castle rising above the spectacular crags. There are stunning views from the course in all directions across Central Scotland – the Ochil and Lomond Hills to the east, the Carse of Stirling, the Trossachs and the Southern Highlands beyond.

                   Sundays are for relaxing! That's why we have a short game hour to work on anything that went wrong in the medal and to catch up with the rest of the group and see how they got on.
